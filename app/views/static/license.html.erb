      How Indiexpo uses cookies<br/><br/>
      A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website that you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.
      We use cookies for many purposes. We use them, for example, to remember your safe search preferences, to make the ads that you see more relevant to you, to count how many visitors we receive to a page, to help you sign up for our services and to protect your data.
      Types of cookies used by Indiexpo<br/><br/>
      Preferences : These cookies allow our websites to remember information that changes the way that the site behaves or looks, such as your preferred language or the region that you are in. For instance, by remembering your region, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news. These cookies can also assist you in changing text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can personalise.
      Loss of the information stored in a preference cookie may make the website experience less functional but should not prevent it from working.
      Security : We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials and protect user data from unauthorised parties.
      Processes : Process cookies help make the website work and deliver services that the website visitor expects, like navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, the website cannot function properly.
      Advertising : We use cookies to make advertising more engaging to users and more valuable to publishers and advertisers. Some common applications of cookies are to select advertising based on what’s relevant to a user; to improve reporting on campaign performance and to avoid showing ads that the user has already seen.
      Analytics : Google Analytics is Google’s analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the ‘__ga’ cookie.
